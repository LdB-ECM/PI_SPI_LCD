SPI to ILI9341 Graphical LCD

Checking we could turn one of these screens upside down for a job because of tight enclosure the connector had to be on right making the screen mounting upside down.

This was the screen

You can see normally the pin connector is on left, not the right like in my image.

So I coded up a quick test on the Pi .. Production is a custom microcontroller which would have required manufacturing a board to test. So the code is hacked together with little care ... you have been warned.
